Introduction
============

**investpy_portfolio** is a Python package created based on `investpy <https://github.com/alvarob96/investpy>`_ data
which aims to create custom stock portfolios. In investment, a portfolio is a grouping of financial assets as well as
their fund counterparts; note that a portfolio can also consist of non-publicly tradable securities. So on,
**investpy** data will be used to create custom portfolios from the data provided by the user such as the asset
symbol, purchase date, number of bought shares, etc.
